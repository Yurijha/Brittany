            <h2><strong>A Peek Into Who I Am</strong></h2>

            <p class="box">Hello, my name is <strong>Uriane</strong>. I have been through a lot in my life. I have done
                everything in my power to be a good and decent man, but I am far from perfect. I have been hurt a lot
                over the years and it has made trusting others very difficult for me. Recently, this ugly truth has
                gotten in my way. I managed to hurt the love of my life emotionally in ways I wish I never had. Her name
                as you see
                here on this webpage is Brittany. She is the most beautiful person and woman that I've ever come into
                contact with.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">Brittany is kind and generous, loving, and faithful. It takes an idiot like me to hurt
                someone so amazing. I have to make up for the damage that I caused because I never want to be in a world
                where I don't have her to cherish and love. I write all of this here because it's live on the internet
                and I want the one I love to see just how much I truly care about her.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">As anyone reads this and most importantly Brittany, I want to make something very clear, love
                is precious. I hope that everyone in this world can find their Brittany. If you ever feel defeated just
                come back to this webpage as a reminder of what love is. It is out there and it is real. I have a
                special person to thank for putting up with my bullshit. Brittany you are incredible and I will shout it
                to the world to prove it to you.
            </p>
